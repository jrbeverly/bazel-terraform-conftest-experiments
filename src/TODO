Here is the process:


1) Provide me a fully working copy of all of the source files
2) Run some means of creating a terraform lock file by `bazel run //..init`
3) Support some means of saving the lock file from source (lock by source)
4) Package everything into a single `.tar.gz` file for publishing
5) Support running `terraform plan` on the output directory (Need provider)
